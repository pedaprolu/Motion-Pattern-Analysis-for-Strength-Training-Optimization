AI-Powered Strength Training Tracker
A Data-Driven Approach to Fitness Optimization

Project Motivation
As a fitness enthusiast with martial arts training, I recognized a gap in wearable technology - while cardio tracking is well-developed, most devices fail to properly analyze strength training. This project combines my passion for fitness with technical skills to create an intelligent workout assistant that provides:

Real-time exercise feedback

Precise performance metrics

Safety-focused form analysis

Technical Capabilities
The system processes wearable sensor data to deliver:

Exercise Classification

Identifies 5 foundational lifts with 98.5% accuracy
(Bench Press, Deadlift, Overhead Press, Barbell Row, Squat)

Repetition Counting

Peak detection algorithms achieve ~95% accuracy

Processes raw accelerometer/gyroscope data

Form Detection

Flags improper execution to prevent injury

Current bench press detection at 98.5% reliability

Technical Implementation

Data Pipeline:
• Anomaly detection (Local Outlier Factor)
• Frequency analysis (Fourier Transform)
• Dimensionality reduction (PCA/k-means)

Machine Learning:
• Random Forest classifier
• Scikit-learn framework

Hardware: Meta Motion wrist sensors

Business Value Proposition
Demonstrates how wearable tech can:
i) Reduce workout-related injuries
ii) Provide objective performance tracking
iii) Make expert-level analysis accessible

Future Development
